                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Many people know that Stan Lee created the superhero, Thor. But even die-hard fans don’t realize that Thor debuted in Venus #11 in 1950. This was when Marvel was known as Atlas Comics. Marvel Comics didn’t launch until 11 years later. In this story, the
                            Roman goddess of beauty, Venus, finds a machine that is supposed to transport anyone to “the third dimension.” (That doesn’t make any sense because we live in the third dimension.) Thor only made a brief appearance in this
                            issue and had no resemblance to the way he is depicted in Marvel nowadays. In fact, the comic that Thor debuted in had nothing to do with superheroes; it was a romantic series. It revolved around the goddess, Venus, trying
                            to adapt to life on Earth. She originally lived on the planet, Venus.

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            In the film, Thor, Odin banishes his son to Earth after he nearly initiated a war with the Frost Giants. In the comics, Thor was banished because he started a brawl in a bar after he won an arm-wrestling contest. I wish they put that in the movie.

                        <p>
                            Originally, Journey into Mystery revolved around horror stories. Journey into Mystery #1 debuted in 1952. The first story revolved around a man who sold flowers that he stole from graves. Eventually, the dead returned to retrieve their flowers. Somehow,
                            the comic went from that to Thor. After Thor appeared in Journey into Mystery, the comic revolved around him until it concluded in 1966.

                        <p>
                            Thor was the God of <strong style="color: rgb(157, 199, 255)">Thunder</strong> in the heavenly kingdom of Asgard until his father, Odin, banished him to Earth for his arrogance. To deprive him of his godlike strength, his mind
                            was put in the body of a disabled doctor called Donald Blake. Blake had such a bad limp, he couldn’t walk without a cane. Odin rid Thor of his memory while he inhabited the body of Donald Blake so he had no idea that he was
                            an Asgardian. He could only reclaim the power of Thor if he proved himself to be worthy.
